# Computational-Physics-Assignments
Most of these codes are a result of assignments that I got during various computational physics laboratories during my undergraduate studies.
These are meant for reviewing purposes and for anyone seeking help from these codes, I would request them to kindly try and understand the logic and mechanics behind the code and try to come up with their own algorithms. Copying these codes won't help you for long. 
I intend to clean these codes, add commments where necessary and make this repository much more informative for anyone intending to learn from these codes whenever I get some time from my studies :)
